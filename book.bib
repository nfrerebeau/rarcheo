  abstract = {In standard multivariate statistical analysis, common hypotheses of interest concern changes in mean vectors and subvectors. In compositional data analysis it is now well established that compositional change is most readily described in terms of the simplicial operation of perturbation and that subcompositions replace the marginal concept of subvectors. Against the background of two motivating experimental studies in the food industry, involving the compositions of cow’s milk and chicken carcasses, this paper emphasizes the importance of recognizing this fundamental operation of change in the associated simplex sample space. Well-defined hypotheses about the nature of any compositional effect can be expressed, for example, in terms of perturbation values and subcompositional stability and testing procedures developed. These procedures are applied to lattices of such hypotheses in the two practical situations. We identify the two problems as being the counterpart of the analysis of paired comparison or split plot experiments and of separate sample comparative experiments in the jargon of standard multivariate analysis.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            After decades of collaborative experience between archaeologists and radiocarbon scientists, with the aim at producing radiocarbon dates capable of answering the most various research questions, it is now widely recognized that an accurate sampling strategy is the cornerstone of a solid               14               C-based chronology. In this paper, we discuss the sampling criteria required to obtain good quality               14               C data within a challenging archaeological context like the Bronze Age site of Erimi               Laonin tou Porakou               (Limassol, Cyprus). Following a dedicated sampling strategy, in the productive complex of the settlement, charcoal samples were collected from secure contexts according to stratigraphic examination of excavated strata and analysis of associated features and material culture. Micromorphology was also applied for a more accurate interpretation of individual deposits and reconstruction of depositional and post-depositional processes. In the necropolis, bone samples were selected among the fragmentary and commingled human remains through evaluation of the preservation state and the minimum number of individuals (MNI). A discrepancy between the charcoal and the bone               14               C determinations was encountered, probably due to old wood issues. The               14               C dates were analyzed using a Bayesian model that incorporates the archaeological information, and a preliminary               14               C-based chronology was defined for this site.},

This model predicts that performance will be attenuated with graphical displays as a function of the particular specifier, or visual dimension, used to code data values. In this review the basic tasks model predicted performance more accurately than did Tufte's data-ink principle. In addition, variability in effect sizes across studies revealed that the model was more successful at predicting performance in local (focusing) tasks than in global information synthesis tasks. Furthermore, the model was better at predicting performance in tasks requiring the use of physically present rather than remembered graphs. Further differences in effect sizes resulted from variability in the exact specifiers used in experimental graphs. Minimal differences were obtained among graphs that used position, length, or angle as specifiers. However, graphs that used area or volume to represent quantitative values were associated with consistently worse performance than found with other formats.},

This note describes some of the more important effects of a constant item-sum on correlation.

The qualitative validity of the “spurious trends” in these diagrams is also shown, when they are interpreted in their proper geological framework. The example previously used by Rollinson to test the usefulness of the log-ratio transformation in the Aitchison and Egozcue article is revisited here in order to fully illustrate the proper use of this tool.},

Accuracy and speed of processing were compared for six different presentation formats: pie charts, vertical bars, horizontal bars, numbers, systematic ovals, and random ovals. Quantities were used in two tasks: a choice task that required larger/smaller judgments and an estimate task that required more precise evaluation. The impacts of blue-yellow color and of a treatment-decision context on performance in the two tasks were also investigated. The study included four experiments. Taken together the results suggest that the formats best for making a choice differ from those best for estimating the size of an amount. For making a choice, vertical bars, horizontal bars, numbers, and systematic ovals were equally well perceived; pie charts and random ovals caused slower and less accurate performances. For estimating, numbers led to the most accurate estimates, followed by systematic ovals. The other four formats led to the least accurate estimates. Color and context did not alter which formats were best. Key words: decision making; quantitative information presentation; questionnaire format. (Med Decis Making 2000;20:228-238)},

Experiments 2 and 3 showed that the effects of ink in the syntactic elements of a graph depend on the location and function of the element: redundant ink in the indicators had limited effects on performance, pictorial backgrounds generally increased response time and decreased accuracy, y axis tick marks generally increased response time, and the y axis line and the x axis generally decreased response time. The effect of each graphical element was conditional on the type of graph and task and the presence of other graphical elements. The discussion focuses on psychological principles that may underlie the effects of each syntactic element.},

  abstract = {Although many well-cited theories or guidelines for visualization design advocate ‘minimalism’, designers tend to include a wide variety of visual embellishments in their charts. Researchers have examined the effects of visual embellishment on comprehension and memorability of charts under specific conditions, such as charts with a small number of data points that were viewed with no time limit (Bateman et al., 2010). This paper extends previous studies and investigates the effects of visual embellishment given different time limits for viewing these charts. Similar to the Bateman et al. (2010) study, we compared embellished charts (selected from the work of Nigel Holmes) and plain, grayscale charts, but we limited our selection to those that consisted of larger data sets (10 or more data points). Results showed that the presence of a time limit affected comprehension and short-term recall performance, while the type of chart significantly affected short-term recall. In addition, the type of chart affected the time needed to review the chart while answering the questions. Participants found Holmes charts more attractive and memorable.},

Tables led to faster responses for all tasks, and the accuracy for tables was equally high or higher than for graphs. Bar graphs and line graphs differed in their relative efficiency for the different tasks. The complexity of the data also affected the tasks differentially, as did prior familiarity with the display. Performance for most conditions improved with experience. Our findings demonstrate the benefits of a multiple-factors approach to the study of displays. Generalizations about the relative efficiency of displays and computational models of the task performance with displays must consider the various relevant factors if they are to serve as valid design aids.},

For every determination included in a scientific paper, the following should apply: (1) the laboratory measurement should be reported as a conventional radiocarbon age in               14               C yr BP or a fractionation-corrected fraction modern (F               14               C) value; (2) the laboratory code for the determination should be included; and (3) the sample material dated, the pretreatment method applied, and quality control measurements should be reported. In addition, for every calibrated determination or modeled date, the following should be reported: (4) the calibration curve and any reservoir offset used; (5) the software used for calibration, including version number, the options and/or models used, and wherever possible a citation of a published description of the software; and (6) the calibrated date given as a range (or ranges) with an associated probability on a clearly identifiable calendar timescale.},

Illustré par 76 figures et accompagné d'exercices avec correction, l'ouvrage aborde la statistique de la manière la plus simple qui soit, sans démonstration mathématique, mais en insistant sur les détails, afin de bien maîtriser toutes les subtilités des tests. Des notions essentielles traitées en profondeur. L'ouvrage explore des points fondamentaux en statistique : la check-list à effectuer avant de réaliser un test, la gestion des individus extrêmes, l'origine de la p value, la puissance ou la conclusion d'un test. Il explique comment choisir un test à partir de ses propres données. Il décrit 35 tests statistiques sous forme de fiches, dont 24 non paramétriques, ce qui couvre la plupart des tests à une ou deux variables observées. Il traite de toutes les subtilités des tests, comme les corrections de continuité, les corrections de Welch pour le test t et l'anova, ou les corrections de p value lors des comparaisons multiples. Il propose un exemple d'application de chaque test à l'aide de R, en incluant toutes les étapes du test, et notamment l'analyse graphique des données. R, le logiciel de référence. L'originalité de ce manuel est de proposer non seulement une explication très détaillée sur l'utilisation des tests les plus classiques, mais aussi la possibilité de réaliser ces tests à l'aide de R, logiciel de référence en statistique, gratuit, disponible sur Internet et compatible avec Windows, Mac OS et Linux. Ce livre parlera également à ceux qui ne souhaitent pas utiliser R, car tous les exemples d'application des tests sont réalisés à partir d'un même fichier de données, qui peut facilement être adapté à un autre logiciel de statistique.},

The inspiration likely derived from the logic diagrams of Llull, Bruno, Leibniz, and Euler, which were familiar to William because of the instruction of his mathematician brother John. The pie chart is broadly popular but—despite its common appeal—most experts have not been seduced, and the academy has advised avoidance; nonetheless, the masses have chosen to ignore this advice. This commentary discusses the origins of the pie chart and the appropriate uses of the form.},

  abstract = {A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},
